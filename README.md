# Titanic-Prediction-Model

The RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage in 1912, crossing the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York City. 
The ship never completed the voyage, sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg, bringing down 1,502 of 2,224 passengers onboard.

In this project Logistic Model is used on datasets to predict which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic based on age, sex and purchased ticket class.

The data is extracted from the Kaggle. The data is transformed and cleaned to remove any missing values which might affect the accuracy of model. In the end, cleaned data is trained using logistic regression to achieve the accuracy of 81 percent.
